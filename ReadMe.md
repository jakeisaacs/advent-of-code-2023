# ADVENT OF CODE 2023

From: [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023)

This is a purely educational challenge for the month of December to perform daily coding challenges to learn/practice languages. List of languages used to solve problems (and how well I know them):
    - C++ (Known but not used in awhile)
    - Rust (New language)
